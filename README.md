# GENDER WAGE GAP

Here we ask and answer the following question:

**What is the difference in predicted wages between men and women with the same job-relevant characteristics?**

Our data comes from the March Supplement of the U.S. Current Population Survey, year 2012. We focus on the single (never married) workers with education levels equal to high-school, some college, or college graduates. The sample size is about 4,000.

Our outcome variable Y is hourly wage, and our X â€™s are various characteristics of workers such as gender, experience, education, and geographical indicators.

The dataset contains the following variables:

1. wage   : weekly wage
2. female : female dummy
3. cg     : college Graduate Dummy
4. sc     : some college dummy
5. hsg    : High School graduate dummy
6. mw     : mid-west dummy
7. so     : south dummy
8. we     : west dummy
9. ne     : northeast dummy
10. exp1   : experience(year)
11. exp2   : experience squared (taken as experience squared/100)
12. exp3   : experience cubed (taken as experience cubed/1000)
